# Project Description

This project conducts analyses described in the Data Curator and Programmer roles for Project 3 (Concordance of microarray and RNA-Seq differential gene expression). All data processing and analysis was performed on BU's Shared Computing Cluster.


The datasets used in this project were presented in:

Wang et al. A comprehensive study design reveals treatment- and transcript abundanceâ€“dependent concordance between RNA-seq and microarray data. Nature Biotechnology. 2014.
